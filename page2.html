                <br>
                <br>
                At first, learning how to make your own game can appear very difficult. You might be tempted to back off and leave game development to the experts. However, I wouldn't recommend doing this! Instead, you should put in a bit of work to learn the basics of video game creation. It isn't as hard as you might think. 
                
                With this in mind, here's a very general step by step guide to help you learn how to make a video game. Note that the exact process varies according to the type of game you're building and the platform you want to release it on, but this will give you an idea of what's involved.
                <br>
                <br>
                
                Step 1: Do Some Research & Conceptualize Your Game

                <br>
                <br>
                The first thing that you need to do when you're trying to create your first game is to think about exactly what sort of game you're planning on creating. Do some research and find out exactly what skills you need to build this game, and what sort of features it should have.
                
                If you're serious about learning how to make a video game, then you should take a couple of introductory courses before you move any further. For example, if you're interested in building a 2D role-playing game, I would recommend having a look at something like the Learn to Make a 2D Game in Unity course.
                
                Alternatively, if you're serious about creating an advanced video game, you might need to put some more effort into it. This study program will suit you best, as it offers two different courses to make sure you get a well-rounded education. 
                <br>
                <br>
                Step 2: Work On A Design Document
                <br>
                <br>
                Once you've figured out how to make a video game, conceptualized it, and started to think about what you want it to look like, you need to put together a design document. For most people, a design document is a brief outline of a game, what it should look like, and what you need to do to build it.
                <br>
                When you're putting together your design document, consider the following things:
                <br>
                The skills at your disposal. Things can get expensive if you have to start hiring people to do things because you don't have the right skills. Also, don't forget that you can always improve your skills online!
                What language/languages you're going to use. This will help you narrow down the way things are going to be built.
                What it needs to look/behave like.
                Whether you want to include updates and new releases in the future. If you do, then you should think about how you're going to make them happen.
                Once you've put your design document together, it's almost time to start programming!
                <br>
                <br>
                Step 3: Decide Whether You Need Software
                <br>
                <br>
                The last thing you need to do before you start discovering how to make a video game is working out what software you need. Simple mobile game development doesn't require a lot of fancy software - in many cases, you can get away with a code editor and compiler.
                
                However, more advanced games can require very powerful and specific software such as 3D modeling programs and image editors. This advanced software can cost a lot, which means that you need to pay careful attention to your budget.
                
                Note that you will also need a computer with a high-quality processor and a lot of RAM to run much of the software required to create complex games.
                <br>
                <br>
                Step 4: Start Programming
                <br>
                <br>
                Once you've downloaded the required software, it's time to start coding! Although more complex games require game engines to run on, simple mobile games don't need anything like this. Simply decide what language you're going to write your game in and get right into it!
                <br>
                <br>
                Step 5: Test Your Game & Start Marketing!
                <br>
                <br>
                Knowing how to make a video game will not make it successful, to be so you will need marketing. The first thing that you have to do is make sure that you test everything about it so you can remove any bugs. This can take an extremely long time, so make sure that you're prepared to sit down for hours at a time testing things.
                
                Marketing is relatively straightforward. I would recommend hiring a marketing consultant to at least get you started, especially if you don't have any marketing experience yourself. Getting your game out there for people to purchase is slightly more difficult, and you have some options:
                
                Create a website where people can purchase your game for download.
                Create hard copies of your game and distribute it via different game stores and other retailers.
                If you've built a mobile game, make sure that you list it on the Apple app store and the Google Play store.
                These are just a few of your options. Again, speak to an expert if you're not sure what the best way to sell your game is.</p></div>
