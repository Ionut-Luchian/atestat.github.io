                If you’re struggling to find ways of bettering your game, you should get some professional feedback on it. There’s a platform created just for that, and it’s called Roast My Game. You can submit your game there for free after you give feedback to some other developer. Although it isn’t a place where you can make money on your project, it will help you gain recognition and support for it.
                <br>
                If you’re ready to start making money from game development, here are platforms that will make it possible:
                <br>
                1. Steam
                <br>
                <br>
                Cost: $100 recoupable publishing fee for each game and the 70/30 revenue split.
                <br>
                Steam is the best known digital distribution platform. Publishing your game there is the easiest way to create a buzz around it.
                <br>
                In June 2017 Valve abandoned the idea to crowdsource their publishing choices when they shut down Steam Greenlight program to introduce Steam Direct.
                Steam Greenlight turned out to be a failure because the community voting system was too easy to manipulate. In result, the platform was flooded with unfinished and substandard games, while small hard-working indie studios struggled to make their work seen.
                With Steam Direct, Valve made a move towards increasing the quality of accepted games. Every game is reviewed manually so good ones are published without obstruction. The $100 fee for submitting a game is supposed to discourage ‘shovelware’ developers. Steam returns the fee after the game earns $1000 in sales or microtransactions, so it’s a further incentive to publish only well-done and playable games.
                <br>
                <br>
                2. GOG
                <br>
                <br>
                Cost: Submitting your game on GOG is free, but the revenue split is 70/30.
                <br>
                GOG is a platform for you if your game is fully developed. There’s no point in sending them an alpha or beta version because they tend to be very picky. They accept only a few games monthly, so rejections are quite common – but don’t get discouraged that easily. GOG team is known for their sudden changes of mind about indie games that are gaining popularity.
                <br>
                The best strategy to get your game on GOG is to create a bit of hype around it before submission. Get active on forums (especially make an effort to gain support on GOG forum), build a website, and develop meaningful relationships with fans on social media. Inform people about every progress in development. This way, when the game is finished, it will already have a community of fans eager to play and buy it.
                
                Although publishing an indie game on GOG may prove tricky, it’s worth a try. GOG takes promotion and marketing of submitted games seriously. Being featured there will definitely make your creation stand out from the crowd.
                <br>
                <br>
                3. Itch.io
                <br>
                Cost: Submission is free and sharing revenue with the platform is optional. You can change the revenue split from default 90/10 to whatever you think is fair.
                <br>
                Itch.io is dedicated solely to indie games. One of the advantages of this platform is that it gives you full control over the appearance of your product page. It provides you with tools to create your own sales or bundles. There’s also an option to set only a minimum price for your game, and allow buyers to pay as much as they want. Itch.io website has the decent traffic of 13.7M visits a month and a considerable number of devoted fans, who are always ready to support promising indie devs.
                <br>
                Considering all that, Itch.io seems to be the best platform to self-publish an indie game. It’s free to start and allows less experienced and low-budget indie game studios to test the demand for their game before releasing it on Steam.
                <br>
                <br>
                4. Gamers Gate
                <br>
                <br>
                Cost: Free submission and 70/30 revenue split.
                <br>
                Gamers Gate is a retail store with games available for download and game keys redeemable on platforms like Steam, Uplay or GOG. With Gamers Gate, you can run a pre-order for your game, publish a demo or beta version in Early Access.
                <br>
                <br>
                5. Game Jolt
                <br>
                <br>
                Cost: Free submission and the revenue split is up to you. You can give them anything between
                0-10% of your profits. Game Jolt takes 70% of ad revenues generated by your game page, and you can pocket the remaining 30%.
                <br>
                Game Jolt is another indie-friendly platform. Although it’s been around for ten years, it’s a bit less known than Itch.io. On Game Jolt, you are welcome to publish games in Early Access and run a devlog on the platform to get feedback and polish your project.
                
                Earnings from your game go to your Game Jolt Wallet. You can use them to support other creators or withdraw them.</p></div>
